/**
 * Settings search reveal for the Tunnel page managed sections (#1764).
 *
 * The tunnel.managed-remote and tunnel.managed-local-config search entries
 * point at sections the Tunnel page renders only for the SAVED tunnel mode,
 * so picking a result for the other managed mode mounted nothing and the
 * reveal loop silently gave up. Search preparation maps each of those
 * results to the mode its section needs and hands it over through the UI
 * store (the providers.classification request-flag pattern); the Tunnel
 * page consumes it as a VIEW-ONLY reveal.
 *
 * View-only is the load-bearing property: the mode selector persists
 * through handleModeChange, so revealing must never route through it, and
 * no save may derive its mode from the revealed mode. The saved mode stays
 * the only mode persistence and tunnel-start logic ever see; the revealed
 * mode decides only which mode sections render.
